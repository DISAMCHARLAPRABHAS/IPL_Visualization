IPL Data Analytics and Visualization
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the Indian Premier League (IPL) to derive insights about player performances, team strategies, and match outcomes. The dataset was cleaned, processed, and analyzed using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Tableau for interactive dashboards.

🎯 Objectives
